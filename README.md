# Spatial Repositioning System (Project D)

**Author:** Levi Laden

## Description
This project explores how to improve the accuracy of place locations by prototyping a spatial repositioning system. It examines different ways a place’s pin location can be defined and works to correct spatial offsets in existing data.

## Goal
Prototype a system that can reposition place locations more accurately.

## Data
- ~5,000 sample places from the Overture dataset  
- Ground truth dataset of 500–1,000 places

## Method
- Assess different definitions of place pin locations  
- Measure spatial offset using ground truth data  
- Prototype modeling approaches to reposition places

## Outcome
A working prototype and initial insights into methods for reducing spatial location error.
